a.**Why must we choose you?**
  First of all I love coding.I aspire to become a confident programmer in the future and I know that this club will help me with it.
  I'm a passionate learner.
  I am also willing to put in the time and effort for the the growth of both the club and personal self.
  I have a very curious mind and I believe that I will be able to learn a lot more from the club which I will use for the development of the club.
  And there are a lot of things which I want to improve and most importantly is coming out of my comfort zone which I can overcome by joining amFOSS.
  Give me a chance, I will work hard and prove my worth.

b.I'm planning to enjoy my college life ,but at the same time use the opportunities provided by the college and club for improving my skills ,
  learning new things and also for a better future.
  I'm looking forward to learning interesting stuffs and give my best in contributing towards the club.
  I would love to work on a project together.
  I am hoping to interact with seniors in the club because after all we learn most things through interactions with others.

c.I will make use of the opportunities provided by the club and improve my skills and thought process and use them wisely for the development of the club.
  I am also ready to share my present knowledge with the other members because after all the growth of the club depends on the corporation and teamspirit of its members.

d.I really liked the way the tasks were ,like they were beginner friendly but at the same time not direct and made us really work to get the outputs.
  Some tasks really made my brain work a lot.But i have a request .I know the best people will be selected but i would like to add that please not only consider the
  kids who already know everything but also the ones who actually put in the time and effort to learn new things.
