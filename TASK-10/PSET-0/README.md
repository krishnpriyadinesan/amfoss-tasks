Before this , I had no idea about what Scratch was.So I deeply researched on it and got to know it is a platform where even kids also easily code and make cool stuffs.
So I have made a game named FLAPPY BIRD which is a famous game among all of us.I spent a lot of time on this learning stuffs one by one.
This is the link to acces the game:https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451028170
